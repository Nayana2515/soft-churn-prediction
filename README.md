# Customer soft-churn-prediction using RFM and Logistic Regression
This project aims to analyze customer churn and retention trends using a variety of metrics and machine learning techniques. By examining features such as recency, frequency, monetary value, and latency over specified periods, the project seeks to classify customers and predict their likelihood of repeat purchases.
# Project Overview
In this project, we use data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore customer behavior in an online retail dataset. By understanding patterns in purchase behavior, the analysis can provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies and reduce churn.

# Features
Churn Prediction: Identifies customers likely to churn based on previous behaviors.
Segmentation: Segments customers into categories such as frequent, occasional, and seasonal buyers.
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis: Measures customer engagement levels to prioritize retention strategies.
Value Segmentation: Classifies customers into value-based segments to inform marketing and sales tactics.

#Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

#Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Retention-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Churn-Retention-Analysis
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Retention_Analysis.ipynb
Run each cell to load and analyze the data.

#Running the Analysis
The notebook includes all necessary code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, and running the analysis. Be sure to follow each step in the notebook to achieve consistent results.

# Dataset
The project uses the OnlineRetail dataset, a transactional dataset from an online retail store. It includes key features like:

CustomerID: Unique customer identifier
InvoiceDate: Date of transaction
StockCode: Item identifier
Quantity and UnitPrice: Transaction details
This data enables customer segmentation and predictive modeling based on past purchases.

# Methods
This project uses the following methodologies:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
RFM Analysis: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis to understand customer engagement.
Clustering (K-Means): Segments customers into groups based on purchasing behavior.
Predictive Modeling: Predicts churn likelihood using models like logistic regression or random forest.
# Results
The project provides insights on:

Customer segmentation by purchasing behavior.
Predicted churn rates and identification of high-risk customer groups.
Recommendations on retention strategies.
(Include visualizations or results here if possible.)

# Technologies
This project uses the following tools and libraries:

Python (for data analysis and modeling)
Jupyter Notebook (for running code and viewing results)
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (for data manipulation and machine learning)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
